                  <h3>Tumescent Liposuction Introduction</h3>
                  Liposuction is a procedure that removes the unwanted subcutaneous fat still existing after all efforts to lose weight have been made. Liposuction is the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure in the United States. It is also referred to as liposculpture, lipoplasty, or suction-assisted lipectomy. The ideal candidate is physically fit and eats well-balanced meals, but is unable to reduce a fatty deposit that is well localized and often seems to involve a genetic susceptibility. There are several methods of liposuction, but the tumescent method is the safest at this time.

                  <h3>Lipo Progression</h3>
                 In the past, the surgery required blood transfusions because blood loss in the aspirate was significant. The tumescent technique allows liposuction to be performed with the patient under local anesthesia; it minimizes blood loss and the risks of general anesthesia. Since its inception, liposuction performed with the tumescent technique has had an excellent safety profile.

                <p><h3>Tumescent liposuction</h3>
                  Tumescent solution is composed of saline or Lactated Ringer's solution, lidocaine (local anesthesia), epinephrine (to prevent bleeding) and sodium bicarbonate (optional).<br><br>
                  Tumescent liposuction uses micro-cannula (small cannula) to suction fat from the subcutaneous tissue and allow for more effective and less traumatic fat removal than large cannula.<br><br>
                 Advantages of the tumescent approach include the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Local anesthesia; less blood is lost. </li> 
                  <li>No intravenous fluid replacement necessary.  </li> 
                  <li>Low risk of infections. </li>
                  <li>The likelihood of needing a secondary procedure may be less.</li> 
                  <li>No down  time. Patients can resume activities after 24 hours.</li>
                  <li>The duration of anesthetic effect may last as long as 24 hours.</li> 
                  <li>The lidocaine (up to 45 mg/kg) is safe.</li>
                  <li>Tumescent liposuction can reshape any part of the body by removing unwanted fat deposits.</li> 
                  <li>The risks of general anesthesia are eliminated with tumescent liposuction (e.g., risks associated with endotracheal intubation, significant blood loss, hypoxemia and side effects from general anesthesia). </li> 
                  <li>The targeted fat compartments can be anesthetized individually with tumescent liposuction providing the most optimal post-operative pain control than standard liposuction.</li> 
                  </ul>
